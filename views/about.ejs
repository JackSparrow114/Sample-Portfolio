          I'm obsessed with making things and even more obsessed with making things better. 
          I've been in the business of creating since I wrote my first story when I was 11. 
          After post-graduating from the University of Nirma as a Computer Science graduate, I've been actively involved in the development community for the last 3.5+ years. 
          I've worked for small businesses, corporations, nonprofits, and more.
          My specialty is full stack design and development, making websites and turning it into beautiful, semantic HTML & CSS. 
          My interests, however, extend beyond the web and I love helping people with learning coding, maths and science. 
          I even love making automation solutions by using python selenium as tool and I also work as freelancer.
          When I'm not coding, I'm probably hanging out with my buddies; playing soccer,cricket or ping-pong; watching sitcoms, or learning something new inspired by Steve Wozniak.
